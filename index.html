            <li><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era
                program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
            <li><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps,
                helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>

            <li><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by

                pest-resistent plants.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering
                intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."

                -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</i></p>
